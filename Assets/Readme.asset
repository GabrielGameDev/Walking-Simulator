  - heading: About SNAPS Packs
    text: 'The SNAPS Prototype Asset Packs are a set of themed 3D models built with
      ProBuilder and is focused on making prototyping 3D levels faster and easier
      for both beginners and experienced developers. '

    text: "SNAPS prefabs are built to real-world scale but are designed to \u201Csnap\u201D
      together when used with ProGrids. \nGrid snap measurements start at 1m and are
      halved ( eg. 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 etc ) according to refinement needed to place
      or position smaller objects."

    text: SNAP pack models were "modelled" entirely with ProBuilder, and are saved
      as .asset prefabs. They can be further customized or modified with ProBuilder
      by using the Probuilderize tool to enable editing.

    text: Each SNAPS Pack caters for a particular theme and while they can be used
      together in a project, they are not designed to be "snap-able" between packs.
      Different themes require different size and scale settings.

  - heading: Requirements
    text: SNAPS packs are meant to be used in unison with ProBuilder and ProGrids,
      both available via the Package Manager. While the packs can be used without
      using the features of either tool, ProBuilder will need to be installed at least
      as the packs utilize the ProBuilder materials and shaders.
